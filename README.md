# IntelliVoiceAI
IntelliVoiceAI is a simple voice assistant developed using Python. It uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API for language understanding and response generation, SoundDevice for recording audio, and gTTS for text-to-speech conversion. IntelliVoiceAI incorporates integration with various applications such as creating reminders in the Reminders app and generating to-do lists in the Notes app.

* Reminders: Create reminders in the reminders app
* To-do-list: Create to do lists in the notes app
